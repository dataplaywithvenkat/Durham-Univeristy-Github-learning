[markdown-syntax.md](markdown-syntax.md)


**GitHub Pages** is a **free web hosting service** offered by GitHub that lets you **turn a GitHub repository into a live website**.

It’s perfect for:

* 📚 **Project documentation**
* 🧪 **Demos or experimental apps**
* 💼 **Company or product landing pages**
* 📘 **Blogs or content sites** (via Jekyll or plain Markdown)

### ⚙️ How It Works

GitHub Pages takes the files in your repository—usually HTML, CSS, Markdown, or Jekyll-based content—and serves them as a static website.

**You don’t need a separate web server**. GitHub hosts it for you, and the website updates automatically every time you push changes to the repository.

### 🛠️ Types of GitHub Pages Sites

There are **3 ways** to use GitHub Pages:

1. **User/Organization Site**

   * Uses the URL: `https://username.github.io`
   * Must be hosted in a repository named `username.github.io`

2. **Project Site**

   * URL: `https://username.github.io/project-name`
   * Can be created from any repo

3. **Custom Domain Support**

   * You can point your custom domain (like `www.myportfolio.com`) to your GitHub Pages site.

### 🚀 How to Set Up GitHub Pages

> Here’s a basic walkthrough to get your GitHub Pages site live:

1. **Create a new repository** (public is recommended).

3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Choose a branch (e.g., `main`) and folder (`/root` or `/docs`).
5. GitHub will show the published link:

   ```
   Your site is live at https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>
   ```

🔁 Every time you push a change, the website automatically updates.
